# **About me**

#### Hey I’m Kelly Cook. I’m a mom, wife and a student. I am a pre-med student at the University of Utah. I am a licensed phlebotomist and medical assistant with aspirations to become a neurosurgeon. I found the inspiration as I grew up in Caracas, Venezuela watching my mom raise me and my two brothers and still have time to become a very well respected thoracic surgeon. 


#### I have been married to my husband, Nathan, for three years (he’s the best). Our son, Achilles, is just over a year old. I love helping others, dancing, listening to stand-up comedy, eating good food and learning/ trying new things. My guilty pleasure is Amazon shopping. I have high expectations for myself and those around me. This girl’s got grit!
